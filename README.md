### Overview
This repository provides a demonstration on how to use the DrFARM source code.

# System Requirements

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The source code has been tested on Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04). The source code should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before using the DrFARM source code, users should have `R` version 4.0.4 or higher, and several packages installed.

### Installation  

First, we need to install `glmnet`, `glasso` and `psych`:  

    install.packages(c("glmnet", "glasso", "psych"))
   
We also need to install a modified version of `remMap` (which is no longer on CRAN) available on this repository:

    install.packages("remMap_0.2-0.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
